Usecase UI is composed of two parts that are usecase-ui and usecase-ui-server. It provides self-service management GUI and monitor GUI for operators and end-users.
This project targets identifying all GUI requirements which operators and end-users need ONAP to support, coordinating GUI parts of each ONAP subsystem, filling the gaps for improving GUI functionalities for use cases.
